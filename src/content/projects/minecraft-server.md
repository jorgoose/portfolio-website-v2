Before this project, I was running a Minecraft server locally on an old desktop that sounded like a jet engine taking off whenever it was running. To provide a more reliable and less noisy server for me and my friend group, I decided to learn how to use a compute instance on Microsoft Azure.

This project was actually one of the things that sparked my interest in programming and software. I modified an existing shell script and used it to deploy a Minecraft server JAR file to a VM provisioned by Microsoft Azure. I also configured settings in the Azure portal to ensure the server was secure and accessible to players.

This was my first experience with cloud services, server management, and Bash scripting for deployment.
