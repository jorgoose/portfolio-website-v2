## Background

InsuriQuest was born out of a desire to revolutionize the way people learn about insurance. Traditional methods often involve sifting through dense documents or navigating uninspiring websites. We envisioned a platform where users could immerse themselves in captivating narratives, making the learning process not just informative, but also enjoyable.

Project background... The idea was simple: what if learning about insurance could be as engaging as playing a game? With this in mind, we set out to create InsuriQuest. Our goal was to break down the barriers of complexity and make insurance education accessible to everyone, regardless of age or background.

### Results

Our efforts paid off when InsuriQuest was awarded the "Best Insurance Hack" at the HackUIowa hackathon. The recognition was a testament to our team's dedication and the potential impact of our platform.

### Design

At the heart of InsuriQuest is our unique story generation algorithm. Instead of presenting users with static narratives, we developed a system that dynamically crafts stories based on user choices. This ensures that every adventure is unique. As users navigate through the platform, their choices are used to dynamically generate a decision tree, representing and storing their unique journey. This approach not only enhances user engagement but also ensures that learning outcomes are tailored to individual preferences.

### Tech Stack

Our platform is built using NextJS with TypeScript, ensuring a robust and scalable frontend. For styling, we opted for Tailwind CSS, which allowed us to craft a modern and responsive user interface. Deployment was handled through Vercel, ensuring seamless updates and scalability. The magic behind our dynamic story generation is the OpenAI API, which crafts unique narratives in real-time based on user input.
