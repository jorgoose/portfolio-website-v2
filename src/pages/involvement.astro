                  Mentored and judged projects at WildHacks, Northwestern's hackathon. Spent the weekend helping students get unstuck on everything from React state bugs to API auth issues as they tried to go from idea to working prototype in about 24 hours. Hackathons meant a lot to me when I was starting out, so it was cool to be on the other side of that for once.

                  Gave a talk and live demo at AI Tinkerers Chicago about Marketmon, a project I built with Chris Tague and Kyle Goben for Anthropic's Build With Claude Developer Challenge. Marketmon generates trading cards based on S&P 500 companies, with stats pulled from real financial data. The demo walked through meta prompting — using one model to write better prompts for another — JSON prefill with the Claude API to get structured responses, and feeding real-world data as context to improve AI output.

                  Gave a featured talk at ChiPy's March 2025 main meeting called "Decoding 'Fedspeak' With Python." The idea was to use ML and NLP to predict Fed interest rate decisions by analyzing FOMC statements and meeting minutes. Built a TensorFlow neural network that outperformed a linear regression baseline at classifying rate actions (raise, lower, or hold) from the deliberately vague language the Fed uses. The whole pipeline, TF-IDF vectorization, stop-word removal, sentiment scoring, and model training, came in under 200 lines of Python. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0bx6kvH6ck" target="_blank">Watch the talk on YouTube</a>.

                  Won first place with Connor Flint at the MCP Hackathon, hosted by Drive Capital and LiquidMetal AI. We built "SwimSmart", a site that pulls live sensor data from Chicago's public data portal to show beach closures and water conditions. Chicago's existing system is manually updated and often wrong, so we wanted something better. We found real complaints about it on Reddit, then built a working prototype with Astro and OpenStreetMap in a few hours.

                  We built "dungeon_ai," a web app that acts as an AI Dungeon Master so you can play D&D-style games without needing an experienced DM. You create a character, allocate skill points, and the AI generates the storyline, environments, and player character images as you go. Got second place.
