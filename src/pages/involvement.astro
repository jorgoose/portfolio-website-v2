                  Mentored and judged projects at WildHacks, Northwestern's hackathon. Spent the weekend helping students get unstuck on everything from React state bugs to API auth issues as they tried to go from idea to working prototype in about 24 hours. Hackathons meant a lot to me when I was starting out, so it was cool to be on the other side of that for once.

                  Gave a talk and live demo at AI Tinkerers Chicago about Marketmon, a project I built with Chris Tague and Kyle Goben for Anthropic's Build With Claude Developer Challenge. Marketmon generates trading cards based on S&P 500 companies, with stats pulled from real financial data. The demo walked through meta prompting — using one model to write better prompts for another — JSON prefill with the Claude API to get structured responses, and feeding real-world data as context to improve AI output.

Chicago's existing system is manually updated and often wrong, so we wanted something better. We found real complaints about it on Reddit, then built a working prototype with Astro and OpenStreetMap in a few hours.

                  My team achieved third place in the Iowa State University CSE Club Programming Contest. The contest revolved around solving programming puzzles on Kattis within a three-hour time constraint. It tested our problem-solving abilities, algorithmic thinking, and coding skills under pressure. Despite the challenging environment, our team demonstrated resilience and teamwork to secure the third-place position.

                  During the hackathon, I worked with my team to develop a social media bot focused on financial education. Leveraging the Discord API, Python, Firebase, NLTK, and the QuickChart API, we created a dynamic platform that provided users with valuable information about finance. The experience of the hackathon allowed us to explore and learn new technologies within a limited time frame, showcasing our adaptability and quick learning abilities.
